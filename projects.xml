        <descshort>A really cool and simple retro chat site!</descshort>
        <desc>I made this as a cool little web Socket.IO chat client with a retro feel, since retro sites are cool. :3 I designed this after a few things: the Apple II, old CRTs, and IRC clients. It is a simple mix between an online chatroom and an IRC client, all with the styling of a retro CRT. I wanted this to look and feel fun and retro, and I think I achieved it! I'm also obviously VERY proud of it!</desc>
