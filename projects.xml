        <descshort>A really cool and simple retro chat site!</descshort>
        <desc>I made this as a cool little web Socket.IO chat client with a retro feel, since retro sites are cool. :3 I designed this after a few things: the Apple II, old CRTs, and IRC clients. It is a simple mix between an online chatroom and an IRC client, all with the styling of a retro CRT. I wanted this to look and feel fun and retro, and I think I achieved it! I'm also obviously VERY proud of it!</desc>

        <descshort>A cool little web animator</descshort>
        <desc>Flow is a little animator that I made, and I'm pretty proud of it! It has the ability to add keyframes and other elements, and I'm gonna add exporting.</desc>

        <descshort>A simple and free SVG program</descshort>
        <desc>FreeVector is a pretty simple SVG program, with features like stroke type, size, saving, and more! The way I made it was a little odd, beacuse I made it by detecting onmousemove on the actual svg element, and then generating a line.</desc>

        <descshort>A mock Internet</descshort>
        <desc>I made this because I wanted my own little Internet to control and curate sites for. This obviously isn't by any means close to how the Internet works, since the way it works is it just serves static HTML files, but it's a cool example! :3</desc>

        <descshort>Pretty self-explanatory lol</descshort>
        <desc>A couple of my friends and I were sitting together eating lunch, and we were talking about accents and how British people say things. This SOMEHOW spiraled into me saying "OREREREREREREO," which made my friend (@ImNotNotUseless on YT) tell me that I should make an Oreo generator, so I whipped it up in 10 minutes, and the rest is history!</desc>
